# MF-TFA_SD-MS
## Introduction
The official implementation of "A Singing Melody Extraction Network Via Self-Distillation and Multi-Level Supervision."

We propose a singing melody extraction network
consisting of five stacked multi-scale feature time-frequency ag-
gregation (MF-TFA) modules. In the same network, deeper layers
generally contain more contextual information than shallower
layers. To help the shallower layers enhance the ability of task-
relevant feature extraction, we propose a self-distillation and
multi-level supervision (SD-MS) method, which leverages the fea-
ture distillation from the deepest layer to the shallower one and
multi-level supervision to guide network training. 

## Important updata
The entire code scripts will be made public after being licensed.
